```terminal
git clone https://github.com/Odelola/less-signupUI.git
```

####  Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```
or

```
yarn
```
===This would install less compiler to convert your less to css===

```
npm run start

===If you have less compiler installed globally on your computer use it and if you want to mess with the code then you can also install less-watch-compiler===
